# First batch of data sets for UI prototype

* The targets should be self-explaining
* In all files, the last column is the target itself
    - leave that one out for the experiments (it's just fixed parameter of the library which produced the data)
* For education, it still shows the numerical value 'education-num' (1-16) instead of the more useful categorical description (pre-school - PhD)
    - I will change that in the coming days, but need to manually write a generalization hierarchy file for it...
